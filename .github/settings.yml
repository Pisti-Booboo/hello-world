repository:

   #description: This is the description of this github repository.

   #topics: game,app,art,concept,futur,client,server,network,linux,video,editor,production,engineering,cad,3d

   #homepage: https://example.github.io/
   

   ## `true` to make the repository private or `false` to make it public.
   #private: false

   ## the default branch for this repository.
   default_branch: master

   ## if true squash all the commits in pull requests for finaly merge only one commit on head of the branch .
   allow_squash_merge: false
   ## allow or not to create a new branch for merging commits in the pull request on the head of the branch.
   allow_merge_commit: false
   ## rebase-merging keep all the commits of the pull requests and add them on the branch head.
   allow_rebase_merge: true
   

   ### Features
   
   ## `true` to integrate the 'task tracking' or `false` to disable it.
   has_issues: true

   ## `true` for enable or `false` to disable the 'projects board'.
   ## (If projects are disabled for the organization, passing `true` will cause an API error.)
   has_projects: false
   ## All of This for Only That... is my thinking when i see the utility of the 'projects board'.
   ## Maybe with required approving review on a pull request 'projects board' will appear more usefull.
   ## for now lets just use milestones and personal 'projects boards'

   ## `true` to enable the wiki or `false` to disable it.
   has_wiki: false
   ## i dont want spend contributions efforts in gh-page AND wiki documentation.
   ## i prefere we focus on just one type of documentation.
   ## gh-page seems easier to integrate in realases for offline documentation and keep the same collaboration process
   ## but GitHub Pages are always public, even if the repo theyâ€™re coming form is private. 

   ## Set to true or false to enable/disable the !deprecated! downloads features on the repository..
   #has_downloads: false
