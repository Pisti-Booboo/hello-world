   has_issues: true

   ## `true` for enable or `false` to disable the 'projects board'.

   ## All of This for Only That... is my thinking when i see the utility of the 'projects board'.
   ## Maybe with required approving review on a pull request 'projects board' will appear more usefull.
   ## for now lets just use milestones and personal 'projects boards'

   ## `true` to enable the wiki or `false` to disable it.
   has_wiki: false
   ## i dont want spend contributions efforts in gh-page AND wiki documentation.

   ## gh-page seems easier to integrate in realases for offline documentation.

   has_downloads: false
