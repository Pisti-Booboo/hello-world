# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

Project maintainers are not supposed to be “social judges”
but they are the arbiters of the project,
and they have power to eject any contributor, for any(or no) reason at all...
But the symbiosis partnership between contributors and maintainers make such abuses of power less acceptable and common. 
And if you don’t trust project maintainers to act in a just and fair way, you probably should not participate in this project.

Information published to a public does not fall under the category of private information.


 explicitly lists protected classes if just for reminding people to give them appropriate consideration, and assuring people in those classes that they are welcome. However, this is not an invitation for rules lawyers to seek loopholes, or to discriminate against others or make people feel unwelcome based on criteria not listed here. (With the notable caveat that those who discriminate or make others feel unwelcome are themselves not welcome.)




Why should accommodate to marginalized people?
It is not about being accommodating, it’s about making all potential contributors feel welcome.

When I code, I just see the code, not the person, so why should I care about this code of conduct? Can’t minorities keep their minority-status to themselves and focus on the code?
Research shows that the two most important factors in successful teams are diversity (“Why Diverse Teams Are Smarter”, Harvard Business Review) and psychological safety (“Foster Psychological Safety”, re:Work). If a potential contributor has to hide some portion of their identity in order to avoid explicit or implicit bias, they may not feel safe contributing to the project. Each person should feel welcomed and accepted and free to bring their whole selves to their work. What’s more, hiding behind an anonymous account, a gender- or racial-neutral pseudonym, or otherwise hiding one’s true identity can have a materially negative effect on building the kind of reputation and open source track record that many employers look for in potential hires.

It’s about establishing a minimal level of civil and professional collaboration. 


In the case of a confirmed violation, project maintainers are expected to meet the violation with a consequence that is proportional to the offense and to work with the offender to prevent future violations. 

women, non-binary people, gay, lesbian, queer, and/or transgender people, people of color, and people of different religious backgrounds should be afforded the same rights and privileges as everyone else.

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we as
contributors and maintainers pledge to making participation in our project and
our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body
size, disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression,
level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal
appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contributes to creating a positive environment
include:

* Using welcoming and inclusive language
* Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
* Gracefully accepting constructive criticism
* Focusing on what is best for the community
* Showing empathy towards other community members

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

* The use of sexualized language or imagery and unwelcome sexual attention or
 advances
* Trolling, insulting/derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
* Public or private harassment
* Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or electronic
 address, without explicit permission
* Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a
 professional setting

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable
behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or
reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions
that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, or to ban temporarily or
permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

Contributor Covenant specifically states that behavior, actions, and communications outside the scope of the project cannot be considered violations of the code of conduct,

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
further defined and clarified by project maintainers.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported by contacting the project team at project@email.com. All
complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.

Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
members of the project's leadership.
