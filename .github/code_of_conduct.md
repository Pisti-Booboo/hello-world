## Our Responsibilities
Project maintainers are the arbiters with full authority rights on this project,
But also they are supposed to be responsible, just and fair

Of course they can remove, edit, or reject any contributions and ban temporarily or permanently any contributors
But its expected to see them having corrective action only against unacceptable behavior.

an essential trust need to be given to maintainers as acting in appropriate way
because the development of this project is a symbiosis partnership 
if maintainers abuses contributors will just stop participating .


## Enforcement
All unacceptable behaviors will be investigated.
And if the case is deemed necessary , appropriate and proportional action will be done.

Be aware that project maintainers  are not supposed to be “*social judges*”
We are sorry for who feel persecuted offended or harassed.
but action will be taken only against project development troublemakers.


## Scope
Communications outside this software project cannot be considered .
