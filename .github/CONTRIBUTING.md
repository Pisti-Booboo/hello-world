guidelines for repository contributors

You can create guidelines to communicate how people should contribute to your project.

To help your project contributors do good work, you can add a file with contribution guidelines to your project repository's root, docs, or .github folder. When someone opens a pull request or creates an issue, they will see a link to that file.
