# Contributing
Every extra step in development process is friction that impedes the work flow.
So help us to maximize the effort we can spend in this project,
take a moment to view how to make contributions easy and effective for everyone involved.

It will show your respect for the people managing this project.
In return, they should reciprocally respect the work you submit

With that being said, you are not required to be an expert to contribute.
even if you make a mistake, another contributor will eventually correct it.
the worst that can happen is you'll be politely asked to change something.
Just use your best judgment, and feel free to propose.

## first off
You might find out that your contribution is not necessary


### use the latest version
Maybe your concern can be solve by just updating your software
check if you are using the latest version.

Be sure to have :
 - your OS updated with latest patches
 - the latest available version of your web browser

Some troubles and functionalities may depend about it.


### read the documentation
Maybe the [documentation](../docs/description.md) can help to solve your concern.
anyway, contributing to this software requires to understand how to use it and how it works currently,
because we expect you to have basic familiarity with the technologies, tools, and libraries. in use by this project
so reading the doc is always a good thing to do.


### search for it
avoid contribution duplication. 
a search about your concern is one of the first things to do.
Maybe your issue as been reported already.
or maybe there is already a work in progress for your idea .
You don't want to duplicate effort.

Its more simple to just add comments than creating new topics.
so If you find an existing issue report or a pull request matching your topic, just add comments or a review on it

it will keep the project clear and save a lot of our time.

## requirements  :
whatever the kind of contribution you want to submit, the following is required.


### speak English
all the people around the world should be able to contribute in this project.
But we don't want contributors communities speaking different languages.
and maintaining the development in many languages is too much difficult.

English is the most widely  language around the world
*[Esperanto](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Esperanto) is a good idea but currently not enough widespread*

So all communications in this project are done in English language.
we request from contributors to write all their messages in English.

But no need to have Shakespeare level in English.
writing a correct understandable English is enough for us.
just with the try to be clear and concise.

*by the way be sure to use nothing else than UTF-8 text encoding.*
*it should be already the case if your computer is not old*


### Adhering Code of Conduct
Of course we want welcoming environment.
collaborating in peace is more pleasant.
its our expectation and it's supposed to be yours as well
for that purpose the [Code of Conduct](code_of_conduct.md) is a good commitment.
all contributors should agree with it.


### expect to wait
in normal case ,it can takes few days before receiving any reply .

of course it depends about :
 - people having interest for the topic
 - how the description message is written
 - the emergency level, requiring action soon as possible if concerning critical urgent security trouble.
 - the period or moment (during holiday and vacation)

it takes time to write good [comments](https://help.github.com/articles/commenting-on-a-pull-request) and much longer for wise [review](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews).
but comments and reviews are necessary before any acceptance and the reason why [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests) are not directly merge.
Consider all this waiting time as part of good software development.

Before submitting your pull request consider theses guidelines below.
the following process will ease the integration of your work in this software project
and its the best way to see your pull request finally merge.


#### style convention
This project do not specify any writing style convention to adhere to.

We just expect contributors will match what they see within a project.
(start by reading what have been done already and you'll get the guideline.)

Because there is no good or bad writing style, its just about personal preferences.
So when a new file is create, the author is free to write it comfortable with his own preferred style.
and then, people who want to edit this file will continue with the author's style.

**Editing files for no substantial change but just for some cosmetic 'fixes'(format space indent) are normally rejected.**


#### Commits


##### Commit guidelines convention
aware about the fact that you certainly make work in first for your own repository fork, 
we are grateful about your sharing offer, 
But our project need to follow some convention for the commits.
Thats why (trying not to be much demanding) we require you to follow our guidelines/convention.


##### atomic commits
prefer '*atomic commits*', forming a single small independent unit of change (concerning only one task at time)
It will be easier to manage without producing conflicts with others commits.


##### Commit Messages
We expect all commits having a comment describing the change.
Theses messages should be understandable by other people and by yourself even in many years.

Do not refer any repositories reference, such as other commits,issue/PR tickets or person,
keep in mind that commits have to be independent, because they can be moved to other repositories.
Same if the commit is justified by discussions elsewhere or external documentation,
then briefly recap the relevant points instead of including ''*short-lived links*''.

Because some contributors already use there own *Emoji* system and dont want to change it
and because its difficult to force people to use correctly a defined *emoji* convention
(especially with the lack of specific *Emoji* ( Linux:penguin: Apple:apple: Windows? )
the decision is to not define an *emoji* convention .
but commit message including relevant *emoji* are acceptable.


##### format

* title
	* begin with a single line summarizing the commit subject
	* first word should be a verb related of what have been done 
	* Use the imperative mood: "Fix bug" and not: "Fixed bug","Fixes bug.","Fixing bug."
	* your line should always be able to complete this sentence: "If applied, this commit will ..."
	* explain what is the change, not how the change is made.
	* Must be maximum 50 characters long. No more, and ideally not less.
	* use lower case characters
	* capitalize the first letter of the sentence.
	* Do not end the line with a period
	* avoid any punctuation marks signs and numbers.
	* Prefix with relevant emoji is optional, but text is always required.
	* do not include any date,names,address,path.

* blank line
	* separate subject line and description text with a carriage return

* description
	* write a verbose description even if the summary is self-explanatory.
	* Do not just give an URL link as explanation.
	* tell what thing need a change and why the change is needed
	* no need to tell how the change is made.
	* feel free to give details, but more haiku than epic tome.
	* Use normal language punctuation and capital letters
	* Multi lines text is recommended.
	* Each line should not exceed 72 characters
	* Bullet points are okay (typically a hyphen or asterisk followed by a single space)


##### No need to squash
No need to squash all your commits into a single commit before submitting a pull request.
All the commits of your branch will be [Merge onto the base branch](https://help.github.com/en/articles/about-pull-request-merges/) .
Just be sure to have your branch up to date, use the fast-forward option if necessary.
Rebase your branch and push it to your repository (this will update your Pull Request):


#### create a new Pull Request
if you followed all the prerequisite above its time to create a *PR*

 - Please dont forget to update the documentation if your changes involve it.
 - and be sure to double check and test your changes before publishing


##### make a draft
You can open a [pull request draft](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) to start a conversation with us if :
 - your idea is ready to take shape
 - you want to signal that your pull request is not ready to be judged
 - if before embarking on significant work you want advice.
 - or not sure that we will takes your pull request seriously

otherwise you risk spending a lot of time working on something that we might not want to be merge into the project.


##### refer issue
 You should remain focused on an issues scope
 and avoiding containing unrelated commits.
 If fixing a bug, there should be an issue describing it.

The process has several goals:
 - Maintain work flow
 - Fix problems that are important for users

**Reference a related open issue has purpose of your patch**


##### check status
The [Status checks](https://help.github.com/articles/about-status-checks) let you know if your pull request meet the conditions set for our repository .
After you submit your pull request, verify that all checks are passing

if you get some fails, do the right changes.
or maybe we can conclude that failure was a false positive or not important.
and then your pull request will be accepted and your branch patch merged.


##### consider comments and reviews
Some additional work can be asked before the acceptance of your pull request.
check and apply any smarts [comments](https://help.github.com/articles/commenting-on-a-pull-request) and [reviews](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-request-reviews).
