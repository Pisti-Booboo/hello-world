### 🍨 🛍📦 types
releases are divided in two categories :
 - **pre-release** *aka experimental releases* introduce new features or rewrite implementations.
 Even if always tested before publishing, it's possible that something included fail to work.
 We expect from advanced adventurous users to test these releases .

 - And when a *pre-release* is considered enough tested and stable, it become the **latest release**.
 Its safer to run theses releases because supposed to include less bugs .
 Even if late bug discovery still possible it will be fix as soon as possible in another follow-up release.


### ⏳⏰📅 schedule
Releases are published when ready, resulting in non-predictable schedule.
Usually a *pre-release* publication is happening when there is enough stuff that needs to be tested.
And it becomes the *latest release* if no bugs are found by enough testers after enough time.


### 🏷️ 🔖 Versioning
Releases are maintained with The [Semantic Versioning guidelines](https://semver.org/).
Sometimes we screw up, but we adhere to those rules whenever possible.
