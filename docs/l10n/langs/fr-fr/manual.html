This requires the following modules to be installed: glib,
GTK+, gconf, gnome-desktop, gio, gdk-pixbuf, gnome-icon-theme, 
shared-mime-info, and libart.

You can get these packages from your favourite GNOME FTP mirror or at
http://download.gnome.org/sources or from other sources where GNOME
packages are distributed. shared-mime-info can be downloaded
from the freedesktop.org website.


Optional Libraries
------------------

'Eye of GNOME' supports the reading of EXIF information stored in
images by digital cameras. To get this working, you need the optional
libexif library. It is available at http://libexif.sourceforge.net.
If you also want to preserve your EXIF data on save make sure you have
libjpeg installed, including the development files.

In order to make 'Eye of GNOME' work as a single instance application you'll
need D-Bus installed in your system. You can get it from
http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/dbus .

Other optional dependencies include Little cms for color management
and Exempi for XMP metadata reading.
